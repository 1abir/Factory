Assume that you are trying to implement syntax highlighting in a programming language editor. The
editor currently supports 3 languages (C, CPP and Python). To perform this, you need to be able to parse
the .c, .cpp and .py source files. Each language has specific rules of parsing. All the parsers implement an
interface named Parser which contains all the functions required to parse a file. There is an Interface for
the aesthetics (font, style, color etc.) of the source codes. The editor uses **Courier New, Monaco** and
**Consolas** font for C, CPP and Python respectively. For simplicity assume that the other parameters (style
and color of keywords) are set to default (Normal and blue). Also assume that multiple instances of the
editor cannot run simultaneously.

Tasks:

```
 Identify the design pattern(s) that can best capture the scenario above.
 Implement the scenario in Java
```
```
Package Details
Silver ATMega32 with load sensor
Gold Arduino with weight module
Diamond Raspberry Pi with load sensor
Platinum Raspberry Pi with weight module
```

# Assignment 2

```
 You just need to implement the structure. For example, you do not need to implement
how the parsers would actually parse the source files.
 For demonstration, user would input the filename with extension on console and see the
selected parser and font name on screen.
```
# Guideline:

1. The main objective of this assignment is to evaluate your design pattern skill. These
   problems can be solved in different ways. But we will evaluate you based on how you
   have applied your design pattern knowledge to solve the problems. Just printing correct
   values will not ensure full marks.
2. Put all the source files in a directory and rename it with your 7-digit student ID. Zip this
   directory and rename with your 7-digit student ID. Finally submit the Zip file (e.g.
   1605XXX.zip)
3. Please DO NOT COPY solutions from anywhere (e.g., your friends, seniors, internet).
   Any form of plagiarism, irrespective of source or destination, will result in -100% marks
   in the online/offline.
